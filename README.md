# Wrapping Area comes from the NES!
An area that warps you to the opposite side from which you left the area. Works on the 3 axis.

- Obj_arg0: Use only X axis
- Obj_arg1: Use only Y axis
- Obj_arg2: Use only Z axis

(If you left the three Obj_args at -1 you'll use the three axis)

You can use SW_A to turn off the area.

Now only works as a Cube but Sphere support it'll be added soon.
